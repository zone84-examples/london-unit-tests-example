## London School of unit tests for testing libraries

This is an example project for [London unit test school: test libraries like a boss](https://zone84.tech/programming/london-unit-test-school-test-libraries-like-a-boss/)
article published at [zone84.tech](https://zone84.tech). You can run it and fully explore the presented solution.

The project shows a simple Kotlin library and a couple of unit tests for them. We chose writing them in the London
style, because classes in the library are loosely coupled, and we could not test them in bigger units anyway. Moreover,
with this style, we can protect the API contract between us and the library users.
